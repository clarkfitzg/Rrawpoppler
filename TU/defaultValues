We can find the default value of a parameter with defaultParamValue.
This gives us back the literal text for the parameter's default.
For poppler, the full set based the 12 classes we processed is

df = lapply(k, function(x) lapply(x@methods, function(m) lapply(m@params, defaultParamValue)))
table(unlist(df))

              0               1            4096 CALC_STRING_LEN           false       formUndef          gFalse           gTrue            NULL          stdout 
             19               1               2               3               2               1              27              12              22               1 
  writeStandard 
              1 


We can handle the literal values 0, 1, 4096, false, NULL.
The gFalse and gTrue are from glib and we can add these to the customization layer, e.g., the typeMap.

We could recognize stdout. However, for R this is problematic and not something we are supposed to use. (Instead, we write to the console.)

CALC_STRING_LEN, formUndef and writeStandard are specific to poppler.

CALC_STRING_LEN is defined in GooString.h as -1
writeStandard is an enum value in PDFDoc.h
formUndef is an enum in Form.h

If speed is not a concern, we can process the header files for enums and global/non-local variables
and find these three.
Alternatively, we can chose to ignore them and require an argument.
